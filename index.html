<h1>How I became a YouTuber:</h1>
	<h2>
		Before when I first started my YouTube channel, I mainly watched gaming videos for fun. But after spending quite some time on YouTube, I then decided to start making YouTube videos on my very own Youtube channel.
		That eventually led me to taking a video productions course in high school. Whenever I was in that course, I found myself spending a lot of time working on my videos even when I didn't have to go to class.
		I simply found myself becoming passionate towards video productions which eventually lead myself to expanding my YouTube channel to the way it currently is now.
	</h2>
	<h2>
	Because I became so passionate with video productions, I even made myself work on a personal project during that class. And that was to create my very first gaming montage video which is the first video that I am shown right here:

	Super Smash Bros. is a one of my most favorite games to play. In fact, all of my videos in my channel are mainly highlights of me playing Super Smash Bros.
	The highlights are all clips of me playing online matches with random people. And once I gather enough clips,
	I end up using them to put together a Montage video such as the first video that I showcased on my website. as well as this next video right below:

		Capturing the gaming footage that I needed for my videos wasn't a simple task. In fact, it's quite a complex task that requires a lot of steps to take especially if I wanted to put together a montage video.
		I wanted to ensure that all my gameplay footage was captured at a best quality as possible, so therefore I had to do something other than to record all my footage with a camera.
		I needed to use a game capture device in order to capture my gaming videos. And the game capture device that I always use for capturing my videos is an Elgato HD60.
 		I find the Elgato HD60 to be quite an excellent device. And if you want to hear more about it, then I suggest watching this video right here where I go over some details about the Elgato HD60.

	<h2>
	I now have more than 100 videos on my channel. And I look forward to expanding my channel even further. And I plan on expand my channel not just in terms of its quantity, but also in terms of its quality.
	In other words, I plan on doing some more editing for my videos so for that next time I post a new video on my channel, it'll be much more entertaining for my viewers to watch on my channel.
